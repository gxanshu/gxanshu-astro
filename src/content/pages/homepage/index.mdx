Hi, I'm Anshu Meena, also known as gxanshu. I'm a self-taught software engineer passionate about full stack development and systems programming. I focus on developing robust, maintainable software, websites and tools that work for the next 20 years.

In my free time, I am an active Open Source Contributor. I maintain my own tools and repos and also contribute to many loved open source projects.

I like system programming, so in my free time I develop system utils and do some experiments with big projects like Chromium and Linux kernel.

I'm an avid reader of history, books about ancient civilizations and psychology. I also love philosophy. Seneca, Aristotle and Acharya Chanakya are some of my favorite philosophers. I also like writing and write about my personal learning and my own thinking about philosophy.

I'm always happy to connect and collaborate. Let's work together! ðŸ§¡
