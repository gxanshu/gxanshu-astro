Hi, I’m Anshu Meena (aka gxanshu) — a self-taught Software Engineer passionate about full-stack development, systems programming, and building reliable software that lasts decades.
I specialize in designing scalable, maintainable systems, developer tools, and web applications with a strong focus on performance, clarity, and long-term sustainability.

I'm an active Open Source contributor — I maintain my own libraries, extensions, CLI tools, and also contribute to well-known open-source projects.

In my free time, I explore system-level programming, experiment with large codebases like the Linux Kernel and Chromium, and build developer utilities.

I love reading about ancient civilizations, psychology, and philosophy — especially Seneca, Aristotle, and Acharya Chanakya. I also write about engineering, mindset, and philosophy from my own perspective.

I’m always excited to collaborate on meaningful work. Let’s connect and build something impactful. 🧡
