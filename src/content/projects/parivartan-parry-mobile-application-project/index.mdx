I am thrilled to showcase my latest project, a dynamic mobile application designed exclusively for Parivartan Parry, a prominent political party in India. Leveraging cutting-edge technology, this app was crafted using TypeScript, React Native Expo, and backed by the robust Firebase platform.



## Key Features:

1. **Secure Login & Signup**: The application offers a seamless and secure login/signup process. Users are required to make a subscription payment to access the app, ensuring a dedicated and committed user base.
2. **Subscription-Based Model**: To enhance user engagement and commitment, a subscription-based model is implemented. Users contribute a fixed amount monthly, supporting the sustained growth of the app.
3. **Geographical Insights**: Users can gain valuable insights into the party's reach by exploring the total number of registered users specifically in Rajasthan. This feature provides a dynamic snapshot of the party's influence in the region.
4. **User Search Functionality**: The app facilitates easy networking by enabling users to search and connect with fellow party members. This enhances communication and community building among the party's members.
5. **Complaint Submission**: A dedicated section allows users to voice their concerns and submit complaints directly through the application. This feature fosters a transparent and responsive channel for communication between the party and its members.
6. **Dynamic ID Card Generation**: As an innovative touch, the app generates dynamic ID cards for users. This not only adds a sense of belonging for the members but also serves as a practical tool for identification within the party.



## Technological Stack:

1. TypeScript
2. React Native Expo
3. Firebase (Backend)

I am immensely proud of this project, which seamlessly integrates technology and political engagement. The Parivartan Parry mobile application stands as a testament to my expertise in mobile app development and my commitment to leveraging technology for positive social change.
