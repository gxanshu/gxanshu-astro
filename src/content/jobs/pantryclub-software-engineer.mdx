I joined PantryClub as a Full Stack Developer and quickly expanded into systems engineering, IoT, automation, and infrastructure. We built our entire operational system from scratch — covering purchase orders, inventory, packaging, warehouse workflows, and shipping without any external services.

I developed a complete Linux-based printing distribution for Raspberry Pi using Zig and C, integrated with CUPS, and deployed seamlessly — zero crashes, zero complaints. Built with NASA’s 10 Coding Rules and Tiger Style principles, it was rock-solid in production.

I also built:

- Auto-GRV system using AI to extract product data from invoices
- Remote Chrome debugger in Go for Puppeteer sessions
- OCR-based text extraction utility in Python
- Full-stack applications using SolidStart, gRPC, and Kysely

This role helped me master designing fault-tolerant systems, maintainable codebases, and efficient multi-language tooling.

Technologies: Zig, Go, Python, TypeScript, SolidStart, MySQL, gRPC, Tailwind, Bun, Kysely, Astro, Hono, Next.js, PWA
