I joined PantryClub as a Full Stack web developer and quickly expanded my skills across multiple domains. This role 10x'd my knowledge and experience in everything. We built many tools and systems to run our business from scratch - a complete custom solution covering purchase orders, inventory, order processing, packaging, and shipping without using any external services.

I created a full-stack application using SolidStart and built web scrapers that use AI to extract meaningful data from other websites. I learned cloud deployment on Fly.io and dove into systems engineering and IoT development.

My most interesting project was creating a complete Linux distribution with a system daemon for Raspberry Pi that pulls orders from our system and automatically prints them. I wrote this in Zig using CUPS C libraries, following NASA's 10 rules of coding and Tiger Style principles. When we deployed the ISO image, we received zero errors or complaints - it was rock solid.

I learned how to write effective, unbreakable, and maintainable code. We designed many systems and I built tools in multiple languages. I created an Auto GRV system that extracts products and quantities from invoice images using AI, then adds them to inventory after verification.

Other projects included a remote Chrome debugger in Golang for Puppeteer connections and a text extraction tool using OCR in Python.

Technologies used: MySQL, SolidStart, Kysely, gRPC, Tailwind, Bun, Zig, Golang, Python, TypeScript, Astro, Hono, NextJS, PWA
