These were the finest years of my life. I started focusing on open source development and created many utilities, tools, plugins, libraries, themes, and templates to help other people.

I also started my own startup - a SaaS project designed to help newspaper PDF designers work faster. It was like Canva but for Adobe PDF software, streamlining the design process for print media.

Here are some of the tools and projects I developed during this period:
