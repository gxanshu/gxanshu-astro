I was a freelance WordPress developer who built many e-commerce and agency websites. I learned a lot about PHP, MySQL, servers, Linux, and many other things.

I hand-crafted some sites without any pre-made themes using WPBakery and other tools. I also did digital marketing and SEO work, which taught me about site speed and search engine ranking.

I still maintain those first sites of my career to this day.

Some sites I developed:
- [theperfumeyard.com](https://theperfumeyard.com)
- [springorigin.in](https://springorigin.in)
- [goldenblush.in](https://goldenblush.in)

Tools used: PHP, MySQL, Hostinger, Digital Ocean, Bash, JavaScript, CSS, GraphQL.
