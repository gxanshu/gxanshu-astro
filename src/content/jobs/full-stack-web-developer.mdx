At [BehumanAI](https://www.bhuman.ai), I built rich interactive UIs using SolidJS, Framer Motion, WebSockets, and advanced Web Animation APIs.

I also worked briefly with Rust on backend services and helped build an AI-powered video chat platform using real-time audio, WebSockets, and browser APIs.

I even rewrote the [bhuman-vad-web](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bhuman-vad-web) package (Voice Activity Detection) to improve voice capture accuracy in browsers.
