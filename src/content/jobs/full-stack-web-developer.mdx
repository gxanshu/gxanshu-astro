I joined a US-based startup [BehumanAI](https://www.bhuman.ai) where I developed many frontend UIs in SolidJS and did animation work with Framer Motion, Web Animation API, Motion libraries, WebSockets, and many other cool technologies.

I did some Rust programming on the backend and used SolidJS on the frontend. I learned about web standards and how to create websites that users actually love to use.

We created an AI video chat app where you can talk to an AI persona and the AI will respond live, all with WebSockets and the Audio API of browsers. I even rewrote a VAD package to clearly capture users' voices: [bhuman-vad-web](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bhuman-vad-web).

It was so much fun working on cutting-edge AI technology and creating seamless user experiences.

Technologies used: SolidJS, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, WebSockets, Framer Motion, Motion.js, Web Animation APIs, Web Audio API, Rust
